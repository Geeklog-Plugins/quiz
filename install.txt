1) Restore the archive under your /plugins directory.
You will have a staticpages folder there already.
This directory is normally at the same level as your sites main config.php file

2) Create 2 new directories under your site's public_html (public) directory
     - public_html/quiz
     - admin/plugins/quiz

3) Install Plugin as per standard Geeklog Plugin Installation steps

   i)   Admin files copied to (public)/admin/plugins/quiz directory
   ii)  Public files copied to (public)/quiz directory
   iii) Themefiles to (public)/layout/{theme}/navbar  - If the navbar directory does not already exist 

    For more details, review the Geeklog plugin installation overview
    http://wiki.geeklog.net/wiki/index.php/Plugins


4) Place the file lib-portalparts.php in your geeklog/system folder with the other lib-xxxx.php files.
Note: You may already have this file there if other portalparts plugins have been installed.

5) Add the new CSS to your theme style.css if you don't already have these CSS declarations.
   New CSS is in the file  'plugins/quiz/themefiles/additional.css'
   Just add the new CSS to the end of the theme's style.css file.


6) INSTALL THE PLUGIN
Note: You need to be logged into the site as admin user to perform this step.

The plugin should now appear as an un-installed plugin in the plugin Editor.
Access the plugin Editor from the Admin Menu -> plugins

Click on the [install] link


You should now see a new admin menu option for the quiz admin.

Thank you for your purchase.
